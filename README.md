# embl-adapter
Contains adapters for connecting EMBL content into GBIF.

Initially this repository will contain an EMBL API crawler that can build a DwC-A file suitable for ingestion into GBIF.
The result will replace the current [EMBL dataset](https://www.gbif.org/publisher/ada9d123-ddb4-467d-8891-806ea8d94230).

The codebase will be Java-based and may run on GBIF or on EMBL infrastructure (yet to be decided, and may change over time).

Expected use of the EMBL API by the crawler is described in [this working document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GCBHAbKZasHRQWcsZFKVRkGlzqXT9XI_dnBTJQk1zj4/edit)
